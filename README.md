## API Integration

The application uses the Groq AI platform with the `moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct` model for HTML generation. The AI is prompted to:

1. Generate creative, descriptive filenames
2. Create complete HTML5 documents with embedded CSS and JavaScript
3. Ensure mobile-responsive design
4. Include modern styling and functionality

## Customization

### Themes
The application supports automatic dark/light theme switching. You can customize the color scheme by modifying the CSS custom properties in `src/app/globals.css`.

### AI Model
To use a different AI model, update the model name in `src/lib/ai-integration.ts`:

```typescript
model: "your-preferred-model-name"
```

### Styling
The design system is built with Tailwind CSS and CSS custom properties. Modify `src/app/globals.css` to customize the look and feel.

## Performance

- **Optimized Bundle**: Tree-shaking and code splitting for minimal bundle size
- **Image Optimization**: Next.js automatic image optimization
- **Lazy Loading**: Components and routes are loaded on demand
- **Caching**: Browser caching for generated HTML previews

## Security

- **Sandboxed Previews**: HTML previews run in sandboxed iframes
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive API keys are stored securely
